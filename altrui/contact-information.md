The aforementioned sequence/set of *Linux/UNIX commands* can be executed in the *Terminal* application of *UNIX*-like operating systems, such as *macOS*, *Linux* (including *GNU/Linux*), *NetBSD*, *FreeBSD*, *OpenBSD*, *Oracle Solaris* (and *Sun Solaris*), and *Illumos* (and *OpenSolaris*).

You can use [online *Terminal* applications](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/admin-notes/blob/main/cheat-sheets/unix-like-os/unix-information.md#online-linux-terminals), or online integrated development environments (IDEs), to execute the aforementioned sequence/set of *Linux/UNIX* commands and obtain my email address.
