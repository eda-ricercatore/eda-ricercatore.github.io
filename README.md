#	Personal Information

##	Biography

Zhiyang Ong is a globetrotting, venturesome cultural chameleon tackling challenges using a skill set that spans electrical engineering and computer science. He is a Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University's electrical & computer engineering department. He is currently working on noise-based logic and embedded deep learning, and had worked on problems in electronic design automation, VLSI formal verification, satisfiability modulo theories, network science (or complex systems), evolutionary computation, network optimization, and multi-objective optimization. He has also designed multiple VLSI circuits and systems, from SRAMs and processors to a Viterbi decoder and a tree adder. In his free time, he is working on solving the Quadratic Travelling Salesman Problem (QTSP) with his research collaborators, using an adiabatic quantum computer from D-Wave Systems. In addition, he is a member of MSC CAMAC (at Texas A&M University), which plans and hosts events to celebrate traditions of different Latinx subcultures as well as raises awareness of issues facing the Latinx community on campus and in the surrounding community.
