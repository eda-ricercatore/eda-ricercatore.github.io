# Preliminary Call for Participation: Secure ASIP Design Automation Group


We are exploring opportunities to design secure system-on-chips (SoCs) based
	on application-specific instruction set processors (ASIPs), develop design
	automation tools/software for design such secure SoCs, and publish
	research papers in the design automation of ASIPs for embedded computer
	vision and bioinformatics.

##	About the Secure ASIP Design Automation Group

It is an informal group that convenes online to present and discuss topics related
	to the design automation of secure ASIPs, develop benchmarks for security
	verification of ASIPs, develop design automation tools and retargetable
	compilers for ASIPs, and neuromorphic processors.

## Goals of the ASIP Design Automation Group

To publish peer-reviewed conference or journal papers based on selected research topic(s).



## Miscellaneous

We strongly encourage people from marginalized communities in their country of
	residence to join us.

This includes women, disabled people (e.g., people who are hearing impaired,
	visually impaired, dealing with learning disabilities, or dyslexic), and ethnic
	minorities.

Also, no matter your current schedule - whether you are a student, working
	full-time, or balancing both as a parent, we invite you to get in touch with us.
	We are committed to inclusive diversity, and we will endeavor to
		accommodate you.
